   abstract = {This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press publishedTheory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded–game theory–has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in theNew York Times, ttheAmerican Economic Review, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.},

   abstract = {This study aimed to understand farmers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding agricultural pest management and synthetic pesticide use in Southeast Asia. Data were used from 900 farm households producing leaf mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern. et Coss.) and yard-long bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis (L.) Verdc.) in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Farmers heavily depended on synthetic pesticides as their main method of pest control. Most farmers were aware of the adverse health effects associated with pesticide use and covered body parts while spraying, but also considered pesticides to be highly effective and indispensable farm inputs. Farmers were largely unable to distinguish between common beneficial and harmful arthropods. Greater knowledge about this was associated with less pesticide use while greater awareness of pesticide health risks was associated with fewer observed poisoning symptoms. For the average farm and while controlling for other factors, farmers who sought advice from friends and neighbors used 45% less pesticide, but those who sought advice from pesticide shopkeepers used 251% more pesticide. Pesticide use was 42% less when a woman was in charge of pest management and 31% less when farmers had adopted biopesticides. These findings suggest relevant entry points for interventions aimed at reducing pesticide dependence.},

   abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions associated with pesticide applications against invasive species constitute an environmental cost of species invasions that has remained largely unrecognized. Here we calculate greenhouse gas emissions associated with the invasion of an agricultural pest from Asia to North America. The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, was first discovered in North America in 2000, and has led to a substantial increase in insecticide use in soybeans. We estimate that the manufacture, transport, and application of insecticides against soybean aphid results in approximately 10.6 kg of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent greenhouse gasses being emitted per hectare of soybeans treated. Given the acreage sprayed, this has led to annual emissions of between 6 and 40 million kg of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gasses in the United States since the invasion of soybean aphid, depending on pest population size. Emissions would be higher were it not for the development of a threshold aphid density below which farmers are advised not to spray. Without a threshold, farmers tend to spray preemptively and the threshold allows farmers to take advantage of naturally occurring biological control of the soybean aphid, which can be substantial. We find that adoption of the soybean aphid economic threshold can lead to emission reductions of approximately 300 million kg of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases per year in the United States. Previous studies have documented that biological control agents such as lady beetles are capable of suppressing aphid densities below this threshold in over half of the soybean acreage in the U.S. Given the acreages involved this suggests that biological control results in annual emission reductions of over 200 million kg of CO2 equivalents. These analyses show how interactions between invasive species and organisms that suppress them can interact to affect greenhouse gas emissions. © 2013 Heimpel et al.},

This is the first investigation of Romanian farmers' perceptions regarding pesticides, thus providing information useful both from the market and environmental protection perspectives. Binary logistic regression was performed to test the relationship between the perceived effect of pesticides, on the one side, and willingness to change conventional with bio-pesticides and willingness to pay for bio-pesticides, on the other side. It was found that the efficiency of conventional pesticides on combating pests and their effects on a farmer's health can predict farmer willingness to replace conventional approaches with bio-pesticides.

Descriptive statistics and a set of econometric models were used to analyze the data. Only 20% of the farmers had good knowledge of botanical pesticides. About 43% of the farmers were willing to adopt botanical pesticides. Education, training, extension contact, and cosmopolite behavior (communication with other people) significantly enhanced the knowledge of the vegetable growers. With membership in IPM club and extension contacts, the odds of willingness to adopt increased by a factor of 7.60 and 4.23, respectively. The use of modern information and communication technology can assist the adoption of botanical pesticides by increasing farmers’ knowledge. Providing farmers with training on the easy preparation of homemade botanical pesticides can also aid in their widespread adoption.},

The contingent valuation method was used to assess the WTP and associated factors among 600 and 700 farmers in Kenya and Uganda, respectively. Fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) was reported as the major maize pest in both countries, while aphids (Aphis spp.) and Tuta absoluta were ranked as the main legume and vegetable pests, respectively. Most farmers (>65%) used chemical pesticides as the main method to control pests, with most of them (>70%) being aware of the negative effects of chemical pesticides on human health. A higher proportion of vegetable farmers (>80%) were WTP a premium price for biopesticides compared to 60% and 50% of the maize and legume farmers, respectively. On average the WTP price was estimated at US$23.33, US$18.27, and US$15.74 per acre among the vegetable, maize, and legume growers, respectively. Being a male, more educated, with higher income, aware of the negative effects of chemical pesticide use, and a risk-taker increased WTP for biopesticides. On the flip side, old age, big family size, and having trust to other community members decreased WTP for biopesticides. Our findings provide insights into the market opportunities of biopesticides in Kenya and Uganda. Training farmers on the benefits of biopesticides may promote their attitude towards the utilization of this kind of pesticides and consequently reduce the use of chemical pesticides.},

   abstract = {The introduction of sustainable practices is considered a win-win strategy for low-income countries because of its potential to simultaneously improve food security and address environmental issues. Despite the numerous studies that focus on the adoption of technological innovations, little work has been done on the socio-psychological behaviour of farmers with regard to sustainable practices. This study investigates smallholder farmers' intentions towards two practices: minimum tillage and row planting. The decomposed theory of planned behaviour is used as a theoretical framework to analyse the intentions. The findings reveal that attitudes and normative issues positively explain farmers' intentions to adopt both practices. Perceived control also has a positive significant effect on the intention to apply minimum tillage. When the intention is formed, farmers are expected to carry out their intention when opportunities arise. Moreover, perceived usefulness, social capital, and perceived ease of operation are also significant predictors of farmers' attitudes. Furthermore, social capital and training are factors that positively affect the normative issue, which in turn also positively mediates the relationship between training, social capital and intention. Finally, it is shown that neither the perceived resources nor information from the media significantly affect farmers' intentions. This paper thus confirms that social capital, personal efficacy, training and perceived usefulness play significant roles in the decision to adopt sustainable practices. In addition, willingness to adopt seems to be limited by negative attitudes and by weak normative issues. Therefore, to improve adoption of sustainable practices by smallholder farmers, attention should be given to socio-psychological issues. This could lead to improvements in farm productivity and enhance the livelihoods of smallholders.},

Population fluctuations were analysed with respect to environmental factors including air temperature, relative humidity and rainfall in relation to different mango cultivars. Mangoes were sampled every two weeks during the two crop years, to assess the damage caused by these quarantine pests on ten main cultivars. Three native species of Ceratitis and a recently described new exotic species, Bactrocera invadens made up the complex of economically significant fruit flies associated with the mango tree in Borgou. Ceratitis species occurred during the dry season and the main species, Ceratitis cosyra, reached a peak at the end of the dry season. B. invadens populations were scarce during the dry season, but increased steadily from the end of April to reach a peak at the end of June during the rainy season. Regression analyses indicated that minimum-maximum temperature, relative humidity and rainfall were the major climatic factors influencing fly populations. Daily rainfall was the factor showing the strongest positive correlation with B. invadens populations. Host plant was another essential factor influencing the population fluctuations. Trapping and rearing data indicated that Ceratitis quinaria and Ceratitis silvestrii, were abundant only in the dry season, causing damage only to early cultivars. C. cosyra, also common during the dry season, attacked both early cultivars or mid season cultivars. A consistent population increase of B. invadens in the early rainy season caused considerable damage to mid season and late cultivars. The seasonal increase of the B. invadens population coincided with the fruiting period of the main mango cultivars in this Northern Guinean savannah, but mango availability influenced the population of this new invasive species only when the rains had arrived. Mean damage on mangoes for the two seasons and two studied orchards increased from 17% in early April to 73% at mid June. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The Dutch government recently adopted the new policy concept of ‘nature-inclusive’ farming, which aims at promoting more sustainable agricultural practices that minimizes negative ecological impacts, maximizes positive ones and at the same time benefits from natural processes. A transformation towards ‘nature-inclusive’ farming faces three key governance challenges that are elaborated upon in this paper. First, agri-environment schemes and other conservation arrangements need to become more effective. At the same time, nature conservation should be mainstreamed in agricultural policies and in agri-food chains. Second, we need shared meanings about nature-inclusive farming. Third, other forms of knowledge production for nature-inclusive farming are required that focus more on farmers’ knowledge needs.},

   abstract = {People perform pro-environmental behaviors not only out of intrinsic motivation, but also due to external factors such as expected social approval or financial gain. To the extent that people use their own motivations to infer the motivation of others, people may view descriptive norms favoring pro-environmental behavior as extrinsically motivated. This may in turn decrease the normative influence of the norm, as conformity can be negatively affected by perceptions that others are conforming mindlessly. While descriptive norms generally promote pro-environmental behavior change, the influential power of descriptive norms varies between studies. One possible explanation for these inconclusive findings is that people interpret others’ behavior as either intrinsically- or extrinsically motivated. We propose that pro-environmental descriptive norms will be more influential when attributing others’ proenvironmental behavior as intrinsically (e.g., pleasure of contributing to the environment) rather than extrinsically, motivated (e.g., fear of social disapproval). In two experiments (N = 1326), we compared participants’ intention to purchase pro-environmental products between four conditions: control condition vs intrinsic norm vs extrinsic norm (Exp. 1) vs injunctive norm (Exp. 2). Results consistently found a significant increase in pro-environmental purchase intention in the intrinsic norm condition compared to both extrinsic norm condition (Exp. 2) and no-information control condition (Exp. 1 & 2). These studies highlight that attribution of behavior is vital for the adoption of pro-environmental norms.},

This paper aims to identify the main determinants of farmers’ behavioral change towards more environmentally friendly agricultural practices in Serbia. In particular, farmers’ intentions to adopt integrated pest management practices have been analyzed. Integrated pest management is a farming management approach which aims to reduce pest population in a cost-effective and environmental manner. To this aim, within a mixed-method research design framework, observational data from 400 farmers have been collected through a structured questionnaire. Theory of Planned Behavior provides conceptual as well as empirical framework for the analysis. The findings provided by structural equation modeling show that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, together with farm size, explain 49% of farmers’ intentions to adopt integrated pest management practices. On the other side, farmers environmental knowledge, education level and the use of extension services do not play a significant role in integrated pest management adoption. Even if the use of a convenience sample limits the generalization of the results to the whole population, findings provide useful information and empirical insights into the development of public policies in Serbia and other Western Balkan countries. The identification of proper incentives as well are needed to enhance the adoption of more environmentally friendly agricultural practices amongst farmers, reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.},

We also assess the individual and combined effects of the campaign channels, which include interactive radio, plant health rallies, mobile SMS and video screenings. Applying a doubly robust method to survey data from 1327 maize-producing households across the two countries, we find that the mass media campaigns are significantly associated with improved farmer knowledge of pesticide risks and safety precautions. While the campaigns appear not to have discouraged the use of synthetic pesticides, they are significantly associated with increased adoption of safer alternatives to pesticides, including sustainable integrated pest management practices. The campaigns are also significantly correlated with increased use of protective equipment against pesticide exposure in both countries and reduced incidence of pesticide-related illnesses in Rwanda. We conclude that mass media campaigns (particularly using multiple complementary channels) can be effective in enhancing farmers’ knowledge about pesticide risks and safety measures, and promote the adoption of safer pest management strategies.},

   abstract = {Integrated pest management adoption is quite low around the globe, particularly in developing countries, due to different factors. Here, we examine the factors affecting the intention of Pakistani farmers to adopt integrated pest management practices in vegetable production using a structured questionnaire. We interviewed 301 vegetable growers in Multan, Pakistan. The reliability and validity of the data, along with the underlying relationship between the observed variables, were identified through exploratory factor analysis. The majority of the farmers (79.4%) relied on pesticides for pest control. More than four out of 10 of the respondents (43.8%) reported that okra received the highest application of pesticides followed by potato (24.5%) and cauliflower (17.9%). Integrated pest management was currently non-existent among the vegetable growers of the study area. The latent factors—“knowledge of the adverse effects of pesticide,” “belief in the efficacy of non-chemical pest control measures,” “perceived barriers to the adoption of integrated pest management,” “progressive farming approach,” and “intention to adopt integrated pest management”—were subsequently confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis. The structural equation model suggested that the intention to adopt integrated pest management is significantly affected by farmers’ knowledge of the adverse effects of pesticides (β = 0.274, z-value = 3.082, P = 0.002). An increase in farmers’ awareness of the harmful effects of pesticides could lead to integrated pest management adoption for pest control. The scale for intention to adopt integrated pest management developed in this study can be used in future studies and provide valuable insights to the policymakers for devising integrated pest management adoption campaigns in the study area.},

   abstract = {<p>Climate change and global warming are of great concern to agriculture worldwide and are among the most discussed issues in today’s society. Climate parameters such as increased temperatures, rising atmospheric CO2 levels, and changing precipitation patterns have significant impacts on agricultural production and on agricultural insect pests. Changes in climate can affect insect pests in several ways. They can result in an expansion of their geographic distribution, increased survival during overwintering, increased number of generations, altered synchrony between plants and pests, altered interspecific interaction, increased risk of invasion by migratory pests, increased incidence of insect-transmitted plant diseases, and reduced effectiveness of biological control, especially natural enemies. As a result, there is a serious risk of crop economic losses, as well as a challenge to human food security. As a major driver of pest population dynamics, climate change will require adaptive management strategies to deal with the changing status of pests. Several priorities can be identified for future research on the effects of climatic changes on agricultural insect pests. These include modified integrated pest management tactics, monitoring climate and pest populations, and the use of modelling prediction tools.</p>},

   abstract = {Despite the great potential of agricultural innovations, the uptake by smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa seems to be slow. We reviewed existing theories and frameworks for the uptake of agricultural innovations and found that these tend to emphasize the role of extrinsic factors such as the characteristics of the adopter and the external environment in the decision-making process. In this paper, we argue that intrinsic factors such as the knowledge, perceptions and attitudes of the potential adopter towards the innovation play a key role, but this has been less studied. We present an analytical framework that combines both extrinsic and intrinsic factors in farmers' decisions to adopt new agricultural technologies and apply the framework to agroforestry adoption as a case study. We review the literature on agroforestry adoption in sub-Saharan Africa and identify the extrinsic and intrinsic variables affecting the uptake of agroforestry technologies. We conclude that the uptake of agricultural technologies is a complex process influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic variables, and recommend that future studies aiming to understand the adoption process of agricultural innovations take into account both sets of variables. A mechanistic understanding of how intrinsic and extrinsic factors interact and drive adoption can help in targeting technologies appropriately to ensure sustainability.},

Agroecological production methods present a nature-based solution to pest and disease management in crucifer and TAV production. We explore the status of farmers’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding agroecological-based production pest management practices. Structured and pretested questionnaires were used to collect data from 1071 vegetable farming households in Kenya and Tanzania. Using descriptive statistics, parametric, and non-parametric analysis, our study revealed that less than 20% of farmers had received training on agroecological-based practices and less than 25% were aware of most of these practices. Among those who were aware of the practices and could confirm their effectiveness less than 12% had adopted them, except for crop rotation and handpicking of pests. This study attributes the low adoption to farmers’ negative attitudes towards the practices. Nonetheless, the study further revealed that training significantly and positively influences the adoption of the practices. Therefore, we recommend that governments and other stakeholders promote targeted awareness campaigns and increase access to training on vegetable production using sustainable pest and disease management practices.</p>},

Consumers are less aware of pesticide-related food-safety issues, and markets providing economic incentives to producers who adopt alternatives to pesticides have been slow to emerge. Hence, overuse of pesticides has been constantly increasing. Although African countries have a number of pesticide-related policies, they are inadequately implemented. However, significant investment has been made on integrated pest management (IPM) innovations in recent decades. Resistant cultivars, agroecological approaches, biological control, and biopesticides have been developed against key biotic constraints in major cropping systems. They have been adopted at several pilot sites, where significant economic and ecological impacts have been documented. However, concerted efforts are necessary to harmonize policies and regulations across the continent to enhance the availability, accessibility, and affordability of IPM innovations to smallholder farmers.},

Because agriculture is a major land use worldwide, changes in farming practices can have major repercussions for biodiversity. Particularly in Western Europe, ongoing intensification and scale enlargement but also land abandonment and poor agricultural practices leading to land degradation form a major threat to agrobiodiversity. Agro-ecological farming practices are suggested as an alternative way of farming in order to conserve and enhance biodiversity. Yet knowledge about what factors explain farmers’ adoption of agro-ecological farming practices is fragmented and incomplete. In this paper, we offer a holistic framework that specifies these factors and how they are interconnected. The framework is illustrated and refined by means of a case study analysis of almond farming in Andalusia. The chosen case represents a specific localized farming practice that currently negatively impacts biodiversity but for which agro-ecology forms an attractive alternative regarding biodiversity. The case study demonstrates that our framework offers a useful tool to systematically identify the different factors that affect agro-ecological farming adoption, interlinkages between factors and particularly the more structural barriers to agro-ecology.},

In order to increase financial inclusion and lessen farmers' liquidity restrictions, Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLA) are being promoted in rural farming communities. However, there extent to which VSLA contributes to the acceleration of agricultural practices, such as SAP, remains little explored in existing literature. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the impact of VSLA on the intensity of adoption of SAPs. Design/methodology/approach: This study used cross-sectional data from 376 farming households in the East Gonja district of Ghana. An Endogenous Poisson Treatment Regression (EPTR) was applied to correct for self-selection bias that might emanate from both observed and unobserved differences in household characteristics. Findings: The empirical results indicated that farmers' engagement in non-farm economic activities, ownership of land and size of agricultural land under cultivation positively and significantly influence the intensity of SAPs adoption. Moreover, participation in VSLA improves the adoption of SAPs, and that VSLA-participants adopted about three more SAPs than they would have if they did not participate in VSLA. Practical implications: This study re-affirmed the significance of VSLA in rural farming communities and recommend that it should be promoted as an alternative to formal financial services to enhance financial inclusiveness, and consequently boost the uptake of SAPs. Originality/value: In the search of literature, this study is the first to estimate the impact of VSLA on adoption of SAPs. The use of EPTR helps to bring out the true treatment effects of VSLA on SAPs.},

Hence, there have been efforts by scientists and policy-makers especially in sub-Saharan Africa to promote the uptake of agronomic and production practices that address these challenges. This study, therefore, aimed at investigating the drivers of adoption of crop protection and soil fertility (CPSF) management practices among soybean farmers in rural Ghana. The management practices investigated included application of chemical fertilizers, biofertilizers (inoculants) and herbicides. The study was motivated by the critical roles that adoption of CPSF management practices play in promoting agricultural productivity. Multivariate probit (MVP) and censored Tobit modelling were used to estimate adoption and intensity of adoption, respectively. Adoption of rhizobium inoculant and chemical fertilizer, as well as adoption of rhizobium inoculant and herbicide application, were mutually exclusive, while adoption of chemical fertilizer and herbicide were found to be complementary. Adoption intensity was higher for female farmers and increased with age, herd size, farm capital and farm size. Furthermore, institutional factors were more influential in the case of inoculant and herbicide adoption while for fertilizer adoption, farmer characteristics were the influential factors. The study recommends that policies to promote adoption should take into account the interdependence among the technologies. Also, there is the need to target farmers who cannot afford the cost of inputs with support in the form of input subsidies to reduce partial adoption.},

Farmers devise different innovations to manage the pest in an attempt to minimize yield loss and production costs while maximizing revenues. Using survey data obtained from Embu County, Kenya, we analyzed farmers’ knowledge and perception as regards the invasive fruit fly, their innovations for the management of the pest, and the determinants of their adoption and dis-adoption decisions of recently developed and promoted integrated pest management (IPM) technologies for suppression of the pest. The results show that farmers consider fruit flies as a major threat to mango production (99%) and primarily depend on pesticides (90%) for the management of the pest. Some farmers (35%) however use indigenous methods to manage the pest. Though farmers possess good knowledge of different IPM strategies, uptake is relatively low. The regression estimates show that continued use of IPM is positively associated with the gender and education of the household head, size of a mango orchard, knowledge on mango pests, training, contact with an extension officer, and use of at least one non-pesticide practice for fruit fly management, while IPM dis-adoption was negatively correlated with the size of the mango orchard, practice score and use of indigenous innovations for fruit fly management. We recommend enhancing farmer0s knowledge through increased access to training programs and extension services for enhanced adoption of sustainable management practices for B. dorsalis.},

Approximately one-third of the farmers agreed that the implementation of IPM is beneficial for farmers’ health. Overall knowledge regarding various IPM practices was low. The adoption of IPM was positively associated with farmers’ education, spouses’ education, large farm size, mass media coverage, and high perception of pesticide applications cost. Marginal effect analysis showed that mass media coverage can increase the likelihood of being in medium and high adopter group by 9.2 and 3%, respectively.

A logistic regression model was used to analyse responses to a double-bounded contingent valuation survey. The results showed that 47% of the respondents are WTP for the IPM strategy. Average WTP per hectare was estimated at US$ 134, revealing an existing demand for fruit fly IPM. The respondents’ WTP for the strategy was driven by farm and socio-economic characteristics.

At the same time agriculture is a major contributor to the balance of payments for African economies. So agricultural production in Africa needs to increase strongly to meet the demands of both national and international markets. Yet fragmentation of land due to population pressure in rural areas, and the low prices farmers are paid for their produce, mean that in many rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa the farms are already too small to provide food security or a living income for the household. There is a high dependency on off-farm income and little incentive to intensify production. Thus rural households are often ‘reluctant’ farmers, lacking resources or the economic incentives to invest in agriculture. The conundrum that must be addressed is how to provide cheap, nutritious food to feed the growing urban and rural populations while creating incentives to stimulate increased agricultural production.

   abstract = {Overreliance on synthetic insecticides in global agriculture is the outcome of a “pesticide treadmill,” in which insecticideinduced pest resistance development and the depletion of beneficial insect populations aggravate farmers’ pesticide dependencies. Examples of the pesticide treadmill have been witnessed repeatedly over the past seven decades, prompting the question whether the rapid uptake and usage patterns of neonicotinoid insecticides and their associated environmental impact are in accordance with this recurrent phenomenon. We hypothesize a conceptual framework in which treadmills are enforced by enabling or disabling drivers within four domains: pest management decisions at the farm level, characteristics of farming landscapes, science and technology, and societal demands. These drivers then tend to create a self-enforcing pesticide “lock-in.” We then analyze several post-1950s historical case studies with reference to this framework, e.g., those involving sprays of the highly hazardous DDT and methyl-parathion, in which the pesticide treadmill was initiated, sustained, and broken, and compare this with current patterns in neonicotinoid use. Historical case studies further illustrate how treadmills occur in three phases in which (i) a limited number of insecticides are routinely used, (ii) resistance development of pests results in the increased crop injury, prompting increased frequency of applications with a wider range of products, (iii) breaking out of the pesticide “lock-in” by policy change and adoption of alternative technologies that lowered chemical inputs and improved agro-ecosystem functioning. The analysis shows similarities as well as differences between neonicotinoid usage patterns and historic pesticide treadmills, and provides guidance on how to effectively avoid or dismantle pesticide treadmills in global agriculture.},

We analysed 681 responses to an online survey to assess which constructs drive intention, and identified which beliefs pose barriers and drive the motivation of farmers to decrease pesticide use. Our results show that the intention to reduce pesticide use is strongly determined by whether other farmers also act. Furthermore, farmers perceive limited capacity and autonomy to reduce pesticide use, and motivations to reduce pesticide use were based on environmental considerations. Finally, decreasing pesticide use was considered risky, but the relative importance of risk attitude was offset by the environmental considerations of farmers. This indicates that farmers need successful examples of how to decrease pesticide use, either via exchange with peer farmers or knowledge provisioning on alternative pest control methods. These insights may be useful to direct policy making to influence farmers' intentions to decrease pesticide use.},

The InvaCost database has enabled the generation of a reliable, comprehensive, standardized and easily updatable synthesis of the monetary costs of biological invasions worldwide3. Here we found that the total reported costs of invasions reached a minimum of US$1.288 trillion (2017 US dollars) over the past few decades (1970–2017), with an annual mean cost of US$26.8 billion. Moreover, we estimate that the annual mean cost could reach US$162.7 billion in 2017. These costs remain strongly underestimated and do not show any sign of slowing down, exhibiting a consistent threefold increase per decade. We show that the documented costs are widely distributed and have strong gaps at regional and taxonomic scales, with damage costs being an order of magnitude higher than management expenditures. Research approaches that document the costs of biological invasions need to be further improved. Nonetheless, our findings call for the implementation of consistent management actions and international policy agreements that aim to reduce the burden of invasive alien species.},

   abstract = {<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) provides an illustration of how crop protection has (or has not) evolved over the past six decades. Throughout this period, IPM has endeavored to promote sustainable forms of agriculture, pursued sharp reductions in synthetic pesticide use, and thereby resolved myriad socio-economic, environmental, and human health challenges. Global pesticide use has, however, largely continued unabated, with negative implications for farmer livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and the human right to food. In this review, we examine how IPM has developed over time and assess whether this concept remains suited to present-day challenges. We believe that despite many good intentions, hard realities need to be faced. 1) We identify the following major weaknesses: i) a multitude of IPM definitions that generate unnecessary confusion; ii) inconsistencies between IPM concepts, practice, and policies; iii) insufficient engagement of farmers in IPM technology development and frequent lack of basic understanding of its underlying ecological concepts. 2) By diverting from the fundamental IPM principles, integration of practices has proceeded along serendipitous routes, proven ineffective, and yielded unacceptable outcomes. 3) We show that in the majority of cases, chemical control still remains the basis of plant health programs. 4) Furthermore, IPM research is often lagging, tends to be misguided, and pays insufficient attention to ecology and to the ecological functioning of agroecosystems. 5) Since the 1960s, IPM rules have been twisted, its foundational concepts have degraded and its serious (farm-level) implementation has not advanced. To remedy this, we are proposing Agroecological Crop Protection as a concept that captures how agroecology can be optimally put to the service of crop protection. Agroecological Crop Protection constitutes an interdisciplinary scientific field that comprises an orderly strategy (and clear prioritization) of practices at the field, farm, and agricultural landscape level and a dimension of social and organizational ecology.</p>},

On a global scale, crop pests are expected to benefit from current and future climate change. However, substantial differences appear across biomes and species. Temperate regions are generally more likely to face an increase in pest attacks compared with tropical regions. Therefore, climate change effects should be studied in the context of local climate and local ecological interactions across biomes.},

A two limit-Tobit model was subsequently applied to assess determinants of TE.

Contemporary projects are increasingly using elementary schools to target households with these foods. Objective: This study assessed the effects of integrated nutrition education approaches, targeting preschoolers and their caregivers, on retention of orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) on farms in the second season after lapse of free vine dissemination initiatives. Methods: Rural farming households, with preschoolers and no prior engagement with OFSP, were targeted. A multistage sample of 431 preschooler–caregiver pairs was recruited for a cluster-randomized controlled trial. After issuing routine OFSP promotion activities, 15 village-level clusters of the pairs were randomized into 1 control group (3 villages) and 3 treatment arms (4 villages each) for the interventions. Baseline and follow-up household-level survey data were collected from the caregivers. The interventions included: (1) OFSP-branded exercise books, posters, and a poem to preschoolers only; (2) OFSP-oriented mobile phone mediated text messages to caregivers only; and (3) both 1 and 2 provided to individual households concurrently. Interventions 1 and 2 were single-channeled, while 3 was multichanneled. We estimated the intention-to-treat (ITT) and treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) effects using a binary logit model and a special regressor method, respectively. Results: Only the multi-channeled nutrition education approach had significant effects (ITT = 0.167, P =.001; TOT =.243, P =.007) on the caregivers’ likelihood to retain OFSP on their farms. Conclusions: The finding implies that multi-channeled agriculture nutrition education interventions through Early Childhood Development institutions can be effective in ensuring sustainable adoption of OFSP.},

   abstract = {Fruit production in Sub-Saharan Africa is of paramount importance both socially and economically. Millions of farmers derive livelihoods from mango, avocado, citrus, cashew, and coconut farming, but native and alien invasive species constrain production The region’s capacity to contain invasives is weak due to the absence of national and institutional support systems for early detection, containment, eradication, or management of the pests. Climate change is expected to play a huge role in the influx of more alien invasive species and the shift of ecological requirements of some native species. Though a fair share of pre-and post-management pest management techniques for several insect pests has been developed, adoption and adaptation of the options are limited. Data on economic and social implications are largely lacking, making it challenging to implement informed policy decisions. The existence of the “Strategy for Managing Invasive Species in Africa 2021–2030” promises a paradigm shift in the management of invasives, from reactive thinking to coordinated proactive approaches. The uncoordinated deployment of management measures in the region and the lack of funding, play a negative role in managing the pests effectively. Prospects for enhanced future research are wide, and efforts are currently being channeled to Area-Wide-Integrated Pest Management in a bottom-up approach with stakeholders owning the process. Participatory development of technologies is also taking centre stage, paving the way for increased adoption and adaptation. Postharvest technologies promise to provide the adequate phytosanitary assurance required by countries importing fruit from Sub-Saharan Africa.},

We find that one-sixth of the global land surface is highly vulnerable to invasion, including substantial areas in developing economies and biodiversity hotspots. The dominant invasion vectors differ between high-income countries (imports, particularly of plants and pets) and low-income countries (air travel). Uniting data on the causes of introduction and establishment can improve early-warning and eradication schemes. Most countries have limited capacity to act against invasions.

   abstract = {The development of large-scale monocropped agrisystems has facilitated increased problems with pests and diseases, perpetuating the reliance of farmers on synthetic pesticides. The economic success of synthetic inputs has, however, been achieved at a high cost to the environment through the loss of biodiversity, depletion of soil quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and disrupting the ecosystem services that can otherwise help mitigate losses caused by pests and diseases. Environmentally benign alternatives for pest and disease management are urgently needed and are now widely recognized as essential for sustainable food and agriculture. The Food and Agriculture Organization, for example, has published the 10 elements of agroecology as a framework for the transformation of agriculture. Agroecology combines ecological and social concepts and principles to develop sustainable food and agricultural systems by harnessing naturebased solutions that are tailored to farmers' needs. Plant-based biopesticides, for example, offer an alternative to synthetic pesticides that are less harmful to the environment and nonpersistent, yet effective at managing pests and have a long tradition of use among farmers so are more socially acceptable. Here, we provide a critical assessment of how nature-based approaches to pest and disease management comply with the 10 elements of agroecology and show how they integrate with other ecosystem services through farmer participatory research. We conclude that the adoption of nature-based solutions for pest management addresses all 10 elements of agroecology and provides an entry point to promote sustainable farming practices among farmers more widely.},

   abstract = {Agroecology involves various approaches to solve actual challenges of agricultural production. Though agroecology initially dealt primarily with crop production and protection aspects, in recent decades new dimensions such as environmental, social, economic, ethical and development issues are becoming relevant. Today, the term 'agroecology' means either a scientific discipline, agricultural practice, or political or social movement. Here we study the different meanings of agroecology. For that we analyse the historical development of agroecology. We present examples from USA, Brazil, Germany, and France. We study and discuss the evolution of different meanings agroecology. The use of the term agroecology can be traced back to the 1930s. Until the 1960s agroecology referred only as a purely scientific discipline. Then, different branches of agroecology developed. Following environmental movements in the 1960s that went against industrial agriculture, agroecology evolved and fostered agroecological movements in the 1990s. Agroecology as an agricultural practice emerged in the 1980s, and was often intertwined with movements. Further, the scales and dimensions of agroecological investigations changed over the past 80 years from the plot and field scales to the farm and agroecosystem scales. Actually three approaches persist: (1) investigations at plot and field scales, (2) investigations at the agroecosystem and farm scales, and (3) investigations covering the whole food system. These different approaches of agroecological science can be explained by the history of nations. In France, agroecology was mainly understood as a farming practice and to certain extent as a movement, whereas the corresponding scientific discipline was agronomy. In Germany, agroecology has a long tradition as a scientific discipline. In the USA and in Brazil all three interpretations of agroecology occur, albeit with a predominance of agroecology as a science in the USA and a stronger emphasis on movement and agricultural practice in Brazil. These varied meanings of the term agroecology cause confusion among scientists and the public, and we recommend that those who publish using this term be explicit in their interpretation. © 2009 INRA EDP Sciences.},

In Kenya, control of this pest is primarily dependent on the use of chemical pesticides, a strategy that has been shown to be ineffective. Although the recently introduced fruit fly integrated pest management (IPM) package developed by the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) has proved to be effective against this pest, there is little demonstrable investigation on its adoption to assess the factors likely to influence its acceptance among producers. A household survey was conducted among 805 randomly sampled mango farmers, and a negative binomial regression model was applied to the data in order to identify the factors influencing the intensity of the adoption of the fruit fly IPM package. Results revealed that 58.5% of the sampled mango farmers adopted at least one component of the fruit fly IPM package. Empirical results indicated that education of the household head, number of mature mango trees planted, keeping records of mango enterprise, use of protective clothing during spraying and participation in the IPM training at demonstration sites have a positive influence on the intensity of the adoption of the fruit fly IPM package in Embu, situated in eastern Kenya.},
