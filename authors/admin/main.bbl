    Invasive alien species (IAS) threaten human livelihoods and biodiversity
  globally. Increasing globalization facilitates IAS arrival, and environmental
  changes, including climate change, facilitate IAS establishment. Here we
  provide the first global, spatial analysis of the terrestrial threat from IAS
  in light of twenty-first century globalization and environmental change, and
  evaluate national capacities to prevent and manage species invasions. We find
  that one-sixth of the global land surface is highly vulnerable to invasion,
  including substantial areas in developing economies and biodiversity
  hotspots. The dominant invasion vectors differ between high-income countries
  (imports, particularly of plants and pets) and low-income countries (air
  travel). Uniting data on the causes of introduction and establishment can
  improve early-warning and eradication schemes. Most countries have limited
  capacity to act against invasions. In particular, we reveal a clear need for
  proactive invasion strategies in areas with high poverty levels, high
  biodiversity and low historical levels of invasion.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    <p>Climate change and global warming are of great concern to agriculture
  worldwide and are among the most discussed issues in today‚Äôs society.
  Climate parameters such as increased temperatures, rising atmospheric CO2
  levels, and changing precipitation patterns have significant impacts on
  agricultural production and on agricultural insect pests. Changes in climate
  can affect insect pests in several ways. They can result in an expansion of
  their geographic distribution, increased survival during overwintering,
  increased number of generations, altered synchrony between plants and pests,
  altered interspecific interaction, increased risk of invasion by migratory
  pests, increased incidence of insect-transmitted plant diseases, and reduced
  effectiveness of biological control, especially natural enemies. As a result,
  there is a serious risk of crop economic losses, as well as a challenge to
  human food security. As a major driver of pest population dynamics, climate
  change will require adaptive management strategies to deal with the changing
  status of pests. Several priorities can be identified for future research on
  the effects of climatic changes on agricultural insect pests. These include
  modified integrated pest management tactics, monitoring climate and pest
  populations, and the use of modelling prediction tools.</p>%

    Biological invasions are responsible for substantial biodiversity declines
  as well as high economic losses to society and monetary expenditures
  associated with the management of these invasions1,2. The InvaCost database
  has enabled the generation of a reliable, comprehensive, standardized and
  easily updatable synthesis of the monetary costs of biological invasions
  worldwide3. Here we found that the total reported costs of invasions reached
  a minimum of US$1.288 trillion (2017 US dollars) over the past few decades
  (1970‚Äì2017), with an annual mean cost of US$26.8 billion. Moreover, we
  estimate that the annual mean cost could reach US$162.7 billion in 2017.
  These costs remain strongly underestimated and do not show any sign of
  slowing down, exhibiting a consistent threefold increase per decade. We show
  that the documented costs are widely distributed and have strong gaps at
  regional and taxonomic scales, with damage costs being an order of magnitude
  higher than management expenditures. Research approaches that document the
  costs of biological invasions need to be further improved. Nonetheless, our
  findings call for the implementation of consistent management actions and
  international policy agreements that aim to reduce the burden of invasive
  alien species.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    National food security in countries of sub-Saharan Africa requires an
  abundant supply of cheap and nutritious food for the burgeoning population.
  At the same time agriculture is a major contributor to the balance of
  payments for African economies. So agricultural production in Africa needs to
  increase strongly to meet the demands of both national and international
  markets. Yet fragmentation of land due to population pressure in rural areas,
  and the low prices farmers are paid for their produce, mean that in many
  rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa the farms are already too small to provide
  food security or a living income for the household. There is a high
  dependency on off-farm income and little incentive to intensify production.
  Thus rural households are often ‚Äòreluctant‚Äô farmers, lacking resources or
  the economic incentives to invest in agriculture. The conundrum that must be
  addressed is how to provide cheap, nutritious food to feed the growing urban
  and rural populations while creating incentives to stimulate increased
  agricultural production. This will require major transformations of the
  smallholder farming systems alongside creation of alternative employment.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Pest management in major cropping systems has long been dominated by
  chemical pesticides in Africa. Smallholder farmers have perceived pesticides
  as insurance to protect their crops. Consumers are less aware of
  pesticide-related food-safety issues, and markets providing economic
  incentives to producers who adopt alternatives to pesticides have been slow
  to emerge. Hence, overuse of pesticides has been constantly increasing.
  Although African countries have a number of pesticide-related policies, they
  are inadequately implemented. However, significant investment has been made
  on integrated pest management (IPM) innovations in recent decades. Resistant
  cultivars, agroecological approaches, biological control, and biopesticides
  have been developed against key biotic constraints in major cropping systems.
  They have been adopted at several pilot sites, where significant economic and
  ecological impacts have been documented. However, concerted efforts are
  necessary to harmonize policies and regulations across the continent to
  enhance the availability, accessibility, and affordability of IPM innovations
  to smallholder farmers.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Fruit production in Sub-Saharan Africa is of paramount importance both
  socially and economically. Millions of farmers derive livelihoods from mango,
  avocado, citrus, cashew, and coconut farming, but native and alien invasive
  species constrain production The region‚Äôs capacity to contain invasives is
  weak due to the absence of national and institutional support systems for
  early detection, containment, eradication, or management of the pests.
  Climate change is expected to play a huge role in the influx of more alien
  invasive species and the shift of ecological requirements of some native
  species. Though a fair share of pre-and post-management pest management
  techniques for several insect pests has been developed, adoption and
  adaptation of the options are limited. Data on economic and social
  implications are largely lacking, making it challenging to implement informed
  policy decisions. The existence of the ‚ÄúStrategy for Managing Invasive
  Species in Africa 2021‚Äì2030‚Äù promises a paradigm shift in the management
  of invasives, from reactive thinking to coordinated proactive approaches. The
  uncoordinated deployment of management measures in the region and the lack of
  funding, play a negative role in managing the pests effectively. Prospects
  for enhanced future research are wide, and efforts are currently being
  channeled to Area-Wide-Integrated Pest Management in a bottom-up approach
  with stakeholders owning the process. Participatory development of
  technologies is also taking centre stage, paving the way for increased
  adoption and adaptation. Postharvest technologies promise to provide the
  adequate phytosanitary assurance required by countries importing fruit from
  Sub-Saharan Africa.%

    This study aimed to understand farmers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices
  regarding agricultural pest management and synthetic pesticide use in
  Southeast Asia. Data were used from 900 farm households producing leaf
  mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern. et Coss.) and yard-long bean (Vigna
  unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis (L.) Verdc.) in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
  Farmers heavily depended on synthetic pesticides as their main method of pest
  control. Most farmers were aware of the adverse health effects associated
  with pesticide use and covered body parts while spraying, but also considered
  pesticides to be highly effective and indispensable farm inputs. Farmers were
  largely unable to distinguish between common beneficial and harmful
  arthropods. Greater knowledge about this was associated with less pesticide
  use while greater awareness of pesticide health risks was associated with
  fewer observed poisoning symptoms. For the average farm and while controlling
  for other factors, farmers who sought advice from friends and neighbors used
  45% less pesticide, but those who sought advice from pesticide shopkeepers
  used 251% more pesticide. Pesticide use was 42% less when a woman was in
  charge of pest management and 31% less when farmers had adopted
  biopesticides. These findings suggest relevant entry points for interventions
  aimed at reducing pesticide dependence.%

    Greenhouse gas emissions associated with pesticide applications against
  invasive species constitute an environmental cost of species invasions that
  has remained largely unrecognized. Here we calculate greenhouse gas emissions
  associated with the invasion of an agricultural pest from Asia to North
  America. The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, was first discovered in North
  America in 2000, and has led to a substantial increase in insecticide use in
  soybeans. We estimate that the manufacture, transport, and application of
  insecticides against soybean aphid results in approximately 10.6 kg of carbon
  dioxide (CO2) equivalent greenhouse gasses being emitted per hectare of
  soybeans treated. Given the acreage sprayed, this has led to annual emissions
  of between 6 and 40 million kg of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gasses in the
  United States since the invasion of soybean aphid, depending on pest
  population size. Emissions would be higher were it not for the development of
  a threshold aphid density below which farmers are advised not to spray.
  Without a threshold, farmers tend to spray preemptively and the threshold
  allows farmers to take advantage of naturally occurring biological control of
  the soybean aphid, which can be substantial. We find that adoption of the
  soybean aphid economic threshold can lead to emission reductions of
  approximately 300 million kg of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases per year in
  the United States. Previous studies have documented that biological control
  agents such as lady beetles are capable of suppressing aphid densities below
  this threshold in over half of the soybean acreage in the U.S. Given the
  acreages involved this suggests that biological control results in annual
  emission reductions of over 200 million kg of CO2 equivalents. These analyses
  show how interactions between invasive species and organisms that suppress
  them can interact to affect greenhouse gas emissions. ¬© 2013 Heimpel et al.%

    Overreliance on synthetic insecticides in global agriculture is the outcome
  of a ‚Äúpesticide treadmill,‚Äù in which insecticideinduced pest resistance
  development and the depletion of beneficial insect populations aggravate
  farmers‚Äô pesticide dependencies. Examples of the pesticide treadmill have
  been witnessed repeatedly over the past seven decades, prompting the question
  whether the rapid uptake and usage patterns of neonicotinoid insecticides and
  their associated environmental impact are in accordance with this recurrent
  phenomenon. We hypothesize a conceptual framework in which treadmills are
  enforced by enabling or disabling drivers within four domains: pest
  management decisions at the farm level, characteristics of farming
  landscapes, science and technology, and societal demands. These drivers then
  tend to create a self-enforcing pesticide ‚Äúlock-in.‚Äù We then analyze
  several post-1950s historical case studies with reference to this framework,
  e.g., those involving sprays of the highly hazardous DDT and
  methyl-parathion, in which the pesticide treadmill was initiated, sustained,
  and broken, and compare this with current patterns in neonicotinoid use.
  Historical case studies further illustrate how treadmills occur in three
  phases in which (i) a limited number of insecticides are routinely used, (ii)
  resistance development of pests results in the increased crop injury,
  prompting increased frequency of applications with a wider range of products,
  (iii) breaking out of the pesticide ‚Äúlock-in‚Äù by policy change and
  adoption of alternative technologies that lowered chemical inputs and
  improved agro-ecosystem functioning. The analysis shows similarities as well
  as differences between neonicotinoid usage patterns and historic pesticide
  treadmills, and provides guidance on how to effectively avoid or dismantle
  pesticide treadmills in global agriculture.%

    The development of large-scale monocropped agrisystems has facilitated
  increased problems with pests and diseases, perpetuating the reliance of
  farmers on synthetic pesticides. The economic success of synthetic inputs
  has, however, been achieved at a high cost to the environment through the
  loss of biodiversity, depletion of soil quality, greenhouse gas emissions,
  and disrupting the ecosystem services that can otherwise help mitigate losses
  caused by pests and diseases. Environmentally benign alternatives for pest
  and disease management are urgently needed and are now widely recognized as
  essential for sustainable food and agriculture. The Food and Agriculture
  Organization, for example, has published the 10 elements of agroecology as a
  framework for the transformation of agriculture. Agroecology combines
  ecological and social concepts and principles to develop sustainable food and
  agricultural systems by harnessing naturebased solutions that are tailored to
  farmers' needs. Plant-based biopesticides, for example, offer an alternative
  to synthetic pesticides that are less harmful to the environment and
  nonpersistent, yet effective at managing pests and have a long tradition of
  use among farmers so are more socially acceptable. Here, we provide a
  critical assessment of how nature-based approaches to pest and disease
  management comply with the 10 elements of agroecology and show how they
  integrate with other ecosystem services through farmer participatory
  research. We conclude that the adoption of nature-based solutions for pest
  management addresses all 10 elements of agroecology and provides an entry
  point to promote sustainable farming practices among farmers more widely.%

    <p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) provides an illustration of how crop
  protection has (or has not) evolved over the past six decades. Throughout
  this period, IPM has endeavored to promote sustainable forms of agriculture,
  pursued sharp reductions in synthetic pesticide use, and thereby resolved
  myriad socio-economic, environmental, and human health challenges. Global
  pesticide use has, however, largely continued unabated, with negative
  implications for farmer livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and the human
  right to food. In this review, we examine how IPM has developed over time and
  assess whether this concept remains suited to present-day challenges. We
  believe that despite many good intentions, hard realities need to be faced.
  1) We identify the following major weaknesses: i) a multitude of IPM
  definitions that generate unnecessary confusion; ii) inconsistencies between
  IPM concepts, practice, and policies; iii) insufficient engagement of farmers
  in IPM technology development and frequent lack of basic understanding of its
  underlying ecological concepts. 2) By diverting from the fundamental IPM
  principles, integration of practices has proceeded along serendipitous
  routes, proven ineffective, and yielded unacceptable outcomes. 3) We show
  that in the majority of cases, chemical control still remains the basis of
  plant health programs. 4) Furthermore, IPM research is often lagging, tends
  to be misguided, and pays insufficient attention to ecology and to the
  ecological functioning of agroecosystems. 5) Since the 1960s, IPM rules have
  been twisted, its foundational concepts have degraded and its serious
  (farm-level) implementation has not advanced. To remedy this, we are
  proposing Agroecological Crop Protection as a concept that captures how
  agroecology can be optimally put to the service of crop protection.
  Agroecological Crop Protection constitutes an interdisciplinary scientific
  field that comprises an orderly strategy (and clear prioritization) of
  practices at the field, farm, and agricultural landscape level and a
  dimension of social and organizational ecology.</p>%

    Agroecology involves various approaches to solve actual challenges of
  agricultural production. Though agroecology initially dealt primarily with
  crop production and protection aspects, in recent decades new dimensions such
  as environmental, social, economic, ethical and development issues are
  becoming relevant. Today, the term 'agroecology' means either a scientific
  discipline, agricultural practice, or political or social movement. Here we
  study the different meanings of agroecology. For that we analyse the
  historical development of agroecology. We present examples from USA, Brazil,
  Germany, and France. We study and discuss the evolution of different meanings
  agroecology. The use of the term agroecology can be traced back to the 1930s.
  Until the 1960s agroecology referred only as a purely scientific discipline.
  Then, different branches of agroecology developed. Following environmental
  movements in the 1960s that went against industrial agriculture, agroecology
  evolved and fostered agroecological movements in the 1990s. Agroecology as an
  agricultural practice emerged in the 1980s, and was often intertwined with
  movements. Further, the scales and dimensions of agroecological
  investigations changed over the past 80 years from the plot and field scales
  to the farm and agroecosystem scales. Actually three approaches persist: (1)
  investigations at plot and field scales, (2) investigations at the
  agroecosystem and farm scales, and (3) investigations covering the whole food
  system. These different approaches of agroecological science can be explained
  by the history of nations. In France, agroecology was mainly understood as a
  farming practice and to certain extent as a movement, whereas the
  corresponding scientific discipline was agronomy. In Germany, agroecology has
  a long tradition as a scientific discipline. In the USA and in Brazil all
  three interpretations of agroecology occur, albeit with a predominance of
  agroecology as a science in the USA and a stronger emphasis on movement and
  agricultural practice in Brazil. These varied meanings of the term
  agroecology cause confusion among scientists and the public, and we recommend
  that those who publish using this term be explicit in their interpretation.

    Fruit flies associated with mango trees were monitored in two orchards in
  Benin using traps baited with methyl eugenol, terpinyl acetate and Torula
  during 2005-2006. Population fluctuations were analysed with respect to
  environmental factors including air temperature, relative humidity and
  rainfall in relation to different mango cultivars. Mangoes were sampled every
  two weeks during the two crop years, to assess the damage caused by these
  quarantine pests on ten main cultivars. Three native species of Ceratitis and
  a recently described new exotic species, Bactrocera invadens made up the
  complex of economically significant fruit flies associated with the mango
  tree in Borgou. Ceratitis species occurred during the dry season and the main
  species, Ceratitis cosyra, reached a peak at the end of the dry season. B.
  invadens populations were scarce during the dry season, but increased
  steadily from the end of April to reach a peak at the end of June during the
  rainy season. Regression analyses indicated that minimum-maximum temperature,
  relative humidity and rainfall were the major climatic factors influencing
  fly populations. Daily rainfall was the factor showing the strongest positive
  correlation with B. invadens populations. Host plant was another essential
  factor influencing the population fluctuations. Trapping and rearing data
  indicated that Ceratitis quinaria and Ceratitis silvestrii, were abundant
  only in the dry season, causing damage only to early cultivars. C. cosyra,
  also common during the dry season, attacked both early cultivars or mid
  season cultivars. A consistent population increase of B. invadens in the
  early rainy season caused considerable damage to mid season and late
  cultivars. The seasonal increase of the B. invadens population coincided with
  the fruiting period of the main mango cultivars in this Northern Guinean
  savannah, but mango availability influenced the population of this new
  invasive species only when the rains had arrived. Mean damage on mangoes for
  the two seasons and two studied orchards increased from 17% in early April to
  73% at mid June. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is a well-recognized fruit of economic and
  nutritional importance to smallholder farmers across Africa. Production and
  marketing of this fruit is, however, severely hampered by fruit fly
  infestation that is responsible for enormous fruit losses. In Kenya, control
  of this pest is primarily dependent on the use of chemical pesticides, a
  strategy that has been shown to be ineffective. Although the recently
  introduced fruit fly integrated pest management (IPM) package developed by
  the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) has proved
  to be effective against this pest, there is little demonstrable investigation
  on its adoption to assess the factors likely to influence its acceptance
  among producers. A household survey was conducted among 805 randomly sampled
  mango farmers, and a negative binomial regression model was applied to the
  data in order to identify the factors influencing the intensity of the
  adoption of the fruit fly IPM package. Results revealed that 58.5% of the
  sampled mango farmers adopted at least one component of the fruit fly IPM
  package. Empirical results indicated that education of the household head,
  number of mature mango trees planted, keeping records of mango enterprise,
  use of protective clothing during spraying and participation in the IPM
  training at demonstration sites have a positive influence on the intensity of
  the adoption of the fruit fly IPM package in Embu, situated in eastern
  Kenya.%

    This paper reviews the findings from the last 20 years on the behavioural
  factors that influence farmers' decisions to adopt environmentally
  sustainable practices. It also proposes policy options to increase adoption,
  based on these behavioural factors and embedded in the EU Common Agricultural
  Policy. Behavioural factors are grouped into three clusters, from more distal
  to more proximal: (i) dispositional factors; (ii) social factors and (iii)
  cognitive factors. Overall, the review demonstrates that considering
  behavioural factors enriches economic analyses of farmer decision-making, and
  can lead to more realistic and effective agri-environmental policies.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    People perform pro-environmental behaviors not only out of intrinsic
  motivation, but also due to external factors such as expected social approval
  or financial gain. To the extent that people use their own motivations to
  infer the motivation of others, people may view descriptive norms favoring
  pro-environmental behavior as extrinsically motivated. This may in turn
  decrease the normative influence of the norm, as conformity can be negatively
  affected by perceptions that others are conforming mindlessly. While
  descriptive norms generally promote pro-environmental behavior change, the
  influential power of descriptive norms varies between studies. One possible
  explanation for these inconclusive findings is that people interpret
  others‚Äô behavior as either intrinsically- or extrinsically motivated. We
  propose that pro-environmental descriptive norms will be more influential
  when attributing others‚Äô proenvironmental behavior as intrinsically (e.g.,
  pleasure of contributing to the environment) rather than extrinsically,
  motivated (e.g., fear of social disapproval). In two experiments (N = 1326),
  we compared participants‚Äô intention to purchase pro-environmental products
  between four conditions: control condition vs intrinsic norm vs extrinsic
  norm (Exp. 1) vs injunctive norm (Exp. 2). Results consistently found a
  significant increase in pro-environmental purchase intention in the intrinsic
  norm condition compared to both extrinsic norm condition (Exp. 2) and
  no-information control condition (Exp. 1 & 2). These studies highlight that
  attribution of behavior is vital for the adoption of pro-environmental
  norms.%

    Despite the great potential of agricultural innovations, the uptake by
  smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa seems to be slow. We reviewed
  existing theories and frameworks for the uptake of agricultural innovations
  and found that these tend to emphasize the role of extrinsic factors such as
  the characteristics of the adopter and the external environment in the
  decision-making process. In this paper, we argue that intrinsic factors such
  as the knowledge, perceptions and attitudes of the potential adopter towards
  the innovation play a key role, but this has been less studied. We present an
  analytical framework that combines both extrinsic and intrinsic factors in
  farmers' decisions to adopt new agricultural technologies and apply the
  framework to agroforestry adoption as a case study. We review the literature
  on agroforestry adoption in sub-Saharan Africa and identify the extrinsic and
  intrinsic variables affecting the uptake of agroforestry technologies. We
  conclude that the uptake of agricultural technologies is a complex process
  influenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic variables, and recommend that
  future studies aiming to understand the adoption process of agricultural
  innovations take into account both sets of variables. A mechanistic
  understanding of how intrinsic and extrinsic factors interact and drive
  adoption can help in targeting technologies appropriately to ensure
  sustainability.%

    It is becoming increasingly difficult to combine nature conservation by
  farmers with intensive and large-scale farming. The Dutch government recently
  adopted the new policy concept of ‚Äònature-inclusive‚Äô farming, which aims
  at promoting more sustainable agricultural practices that minimizes negative
  ecological impacts, maximizes positive ones and at the same time benefits
  from natural processes. A transformation towards ‚Äònature-inclusive‚Äô
  farming faces three key governance challenges that are elaborated upon in
  this paper. First, agri-environment schemes and other conservation
  arrangements need to become more effective. At the same time, nature
  conservation should be mainstreamed in agricultural policies and in agri-food
  chains. Second, we need shared meanings about nature-inclusive farming.
  Third, other forms of knowledge production for nature-inclusive farming are
  required that focus more on farmers‚Äô knowledge needs.%

  ongoing intensification and scale enlargement but also land abandonment and
  poor agricultural practices leading to land degradation form a major threat
  to agrobiodiversity. Agro-ecological farming practices are suggested as an
  alternative way of farming in order to conserve and enhance biodiversity. Yet
  knowledge about what factors explain farmers‚Äô adoption of agro-ecological
  farming practices is fragmented and incomplete. In this paper, we offer a
  holistic framework that specifies these factors and how they are
  interconnected. The framework is illustrated and refined by means of a case
  study analysis of almond farming in Andalusia. The chosen case represents a
  specific localized farming practice that currently negatively impacts
  biodiversity but for which agro-ecology forms an attractive alternative
  regarding biodiversity. The case study demonstrates that our framework offers
  a useful tool to systematically identify the different factors that affect
  agro-ecological farming adoption, interlinkages between factors and
  particularly the more structural barriers to agro-ecology.%

    Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia as European Union candidate
  countries, have to follow EU directives that include the adoption of several
  agri-environmental measures for promoting cleaner agricultural practices
  among farmers in the years to come. This paper aims to identify the main
  determinants of farmers‚Äô behavioral change towards more environmentally
  friendly agricultural practices in Serbia. In particular, farmers‚Äô
  intentions to adopt integrated pest management practices have been analyzed.
  Integrated pest management is a farming management approach which aims to
  reduce pest population in a cost-effective and environmental manner. To this
  aim, within a mixed-method research design framework, observational data from
  400 farmers have been collected through a structured questionnaire. Theory of
  Planned Behavior provides conceptual as well as empirical framework for the
  analysis. The findings provided by structural equation modeling show that
  attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, together with
  farm size, explain 49% of farmers‚Äô intentions to adopt integrated pest
  management practices. On the other side, farmers environmental knowledge,
  education level and the use of extension services do not play a significant
  role in integrated pest management adoption. Even if the use of a convenience
  sample limits the generalization of the results to the whole population,
  findings provide useful information and empirical insights into the
  development of public policies in Serbia and other Western Balkan countries.
  The identification of proper incentives as well are needed to enhance the
  adoption of more environmentally friendly agricultural practices amongst
  farmers, reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.%

    Integrated pest management adoption is quite low around the globe,
  particularly in developing countries, due to different factors. Here, we
  examine the factors affecting the intention of Pakistani farmers to adopt
  integrated pest management practices in vegetable production using a
  structured questionnaire. We interviewed 301 vegetable growers in Multan,
  Pakistan. The reliability and validity of the data, along with the underlying
  relationship between the observed variables, were identified through
  exploratory factor analysis. The majority of the farmers (79.4%) relied on
  pesticides for pest control. More than four out of 10 of the respondents
  (43.8%) reported that okra received the highest application of pesticides
  followed by potato (24.5%) and cauliflower (17.9%). Integrated pest
  management was currently non-existent among the vegetable growers of the
  study area. The latent factors‚Äî‚Äúknowledge of the adverse effects of
  pesticide,‚Äù ‚Äúbelief in the efficacy of non-chemical pest control
  measures,‚Äù ‚Äúperceived barriers to the adoption of integrated pest
  management,‚Äù ‚Äúprogressive farming approach,‚Äù and ‚Äúintention to adopt
  integrated pest management‚Äù‚Äîwere subsequently confirmed using
  confirmatory factor analysis. The structural equation¬†model suggested that
  the intention to adopt integrated pest management is significantly affected
  by farmers‚Äô knowledge of the adverse effects of pesticides (Œ≤¬†=¬†0.274,
  z-value¬†=¬†3.082, P¬†=¬†0.002). An increase in farmers‚Äô awareness of the
  harmful effects of pesticides could lead to integrated pest management
  adoption for pest control. The scale for intention to adopt integrated pest
  management developed in this study can be used in future studies and provide
  valuable insights to the policymakers for devising integrated pest management
  adoption campaigns in the study area.%

    The environmental impact of conventional food production systems imposes a
  rapid tran-sition towards sustainable production systems through the adoption
  of agroecological practices. The barriers and accelerators of the adoption of
  agroecological practices were identified for horticultural crops in

  producers. Results show that the loss of producer income and the lack of
  social awareness regarding organic products are among the important barriers
  to the adoption of agroecological practices, while information about the
  experience of other farmers is considered a motivational factor. Finally, the

    Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) is one of the most economically important
  invasive pests affecting horticulture production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
  Mango is the main host for this species and causes up to 80% yield loss. To
  mitigate against this pest, an area-wide integrated pest management (IPM)
  programme is being promoted in SSA, and Ethiopia is next in line for
  roll-out. The IPM strategy reduces pesticide use and generates significant
  income. However, implementation of the IPM requires significant time
  investment for pest identification, scouting, certain infrastructure,
  creating awareness and training for area-wide adoption. To assess farmers‚Äô
  knowledge and perceptions of B. dorsalis and their willingness to pay (WTP)
  for the IPM, 365 households were interviewed in two mango producing districts
  in Goma Gofa zone in Ethiopia. A logistic regression model was used to
  analyse responses to a double-bounded contingent valuation survey. The
  results showed that 47% of the respondents are WTP for the IPM strategy.
  Average WTP per hectare was estimated at US$ 134, revealing an existing
  demand for fruit fly IPM. The respondents‚Äô WTP for the strategy was driven
  by farm and socio-economic characteristics. Enhancing skills of extension
  agents could foster IPM dissemination and adoption among mango growers in
  this region.%

    We utilized data from cereal, legume, and vegetable growers in Kenya and
  Uganda to assess their knowledge and management practices of common pests and
  willingness to pay (WTP) for biopesticides. The contingent valuation method
  was used to assess the WTP and associated factors among 600 and 700 farmers
  in Kenya and Uganda, respectively. Fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) was
  reported as the major maize pest in both countries, while aphids (Aphis spp.)
  and Tuta absoluta were ranked as the main legume and vegetable pests,
  respectively. Most farmers (>65%) used chemical pesticides as the main method
  to control pests, with most of them (>70%) being aware of the negative
  effects of chemical pesticides on human health. A higher proportion of
  vegetable farmers (>80%) were WTP a premium price for biopesticides compared
  to 60% and 50% of the maize and legume farmers, respectively. On average the
  WTP price was estimated at US$23.33, US$18.27, and US$15.74 per acre among
  the vegetable, maize, and legume growers, respectively. Being a male, more
  educated, with higher income, aware of the negative effects of chemical
  pesticide use, and a risk-taker increased WTP for biopesticides. On the flip
  side, old age, big family size, and having trust to other community members
  decreased WTP for biopesticides. Our findings provide insights into the
  market opportunities of biopesticides in Kenya and Uganda. Training farmers
  on the benefits of biopesticides may promote their attitude towards the
  utilization of this kind of pesticides and consequently reduce the use of
  chemical pesticides.%

  health can predict farmer willingness to replace conventional approaches with
  bio-pesticides. Conclusions disclose entry points for interventions aimed at
  improving communication and information strategies at the country level for
  raising awareness of the adverse effects of pesticide products, both at the
  food consumer and farmer levels.%

    Sorghum plot managers in different locations have varying levels of
  resource endowment that in turn influence technical efficiency (TE).
  Therefore, plot managers operate at different levels of technology. The
  present study applied a stochastic metafrontier approach to assess TE and
  technology gaps of female, male and jointly-managed sorghum plots. A two
  limit-Tobit model was subsequently applied to assess determinants of TE.
  Results indicate that male-managed sorghum plots had the highest metafrontier
  technical efficiencies (MTEs) (61%, 56% and 15%) and technology gap ratios
  (TGRs) (98%, 92% and 20%) for Lira, Serere and Kumi districts, respectively
  compared to female and jointly managed plots. However, jointly managed plots
  had higher TE and TGRs compared to female plot managers but lower than those
  of the male-managed plots. Age, distance to plot and farmer group membership
  influenced TE positively while household size, years of farming sorghum and
  access to credit had negative effects on efficiency.%

    Background: Biofortified staples have been promoted widely in sub-Saharan
  Africa to combat micronutrient deficiencies. Contemporary projects are
  increasingly using elementary schools to target households with these foods.
  Objective: This study assessed the effects of integrated nutrition education
  approaches, targeting preschoolers and their caregivers, on retention of
  orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) on farms in the second season after lapse
  of free vine dissemination initiatives. Methods: Rural farming households,
  with preschoolers and no prior engagement with OFSP, were targeted. A
  multistage sample of 431 preschooler‚Äìcaregiver pairs was recruited for a
  cluster-randomized controlled trial. After issuing routine OFSP promotion
  activities, 15 village-level clusters of the pairs were randomized into 1
  control group (3 villages) and 3 treatment arms (4 villages each) for the
  interventions. Baseline and follow-up household-level survey data were
  collected from the caregivers. The interventions included: (1) OFSP-branded
  exercise books, posters, and a poem to preschoolers only; (2) OFSP-oriented
  mobile phone mediated text messages to caregivers only; and (3) both 1 and 2
  provided to individual households concurrently. Interventions 1 and 2 were
  single-channeled, while 3 was multichanneled. We estimated the
  intention-to-treat (ITT) and treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) effects using a
  binary logit model and a special regressor method, respectively. Results:
  Only the multi-channeled nutrition education approach had significant effects
  (ITT = 0.167, P =.001; TOT =.243, P =.007) on the caregivers‚Äô likelihood to
  retain OFSP on their farms. Conclusions: The finding implies that
  multi-channeled agriculture nutrition education interventions through Early
  Childhood Development institutions can be effective in ensuring sustainable
  adoption of OFSP.%

    This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What
  began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and
  an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton
  University Press publishedTheory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John
  von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical
  theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of
  strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new
  field of scientific inquiry it yielded‚Äìgame theory‚Äìhas since been widely
  used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal
  policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major
  league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout
  both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.This sixtieth
  anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an
  introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews
  and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original
  publication in theNew York Times, ttheAmerican Economic Review, and a variety
  of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless
  opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound

    \field{abstract}{%
    Integrated pest management (IPM) is a way of managing agricultural pests
  using ecological principles and with minimum damage to the environment and
  human health. In developing countries, numerous IPM programs have been
  developed with the intent of increasing yields, reducing costs, and
  minimizing adverse impacts of pest management. Despite its promise and many
  millions of dollars being spent on training and diffusion, IPM has not been
  widely adopted in developing countries. This paper provides evidence about
  what is known about global adoption, what factors have been identified as
  obstacles to more widespread adoption, and ways of overcoming these factors.
  Behavioral economics provides insights that help explain lagging IPM adoption
  and promises potential for relatively simple solutions. Means of evaluating
  and implementing behavioral economics approaches are described and some
  lessons are gleaned from a single study employing these approaches in
  Ecuador. Implications for broader diffusion are discussed.%

    In this paper we examine the following two hypotheses, which traditional
  theories of capital structure are relatively silent about: (i) the
  determinants of financial leverage decisions are different for micro, small,
  medium and large firms; and (ii) the factors that determine whether or not a
  firm issues debt are different from those that determine how much debt it
  issues. Using a binary choice model to explain the probability of a firm
  raising debt and a fractional regression model to explain the relative amount
  of debt issued, we find strong support for both hypotheses. Confirming recent
  empirical evidence, we find also that, although larger firms are more likely
  to use debt, conditional on their having some debt, firm size is negatively
  related to the proportion of debt used by firms. ¬© 2009 Taylor & Francis.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Bangladeshi vegetable growers rely heavily on chemical pesticides to manage
  pests. Botanical pesticides are often promoted as an environmentally friendly
  way to control pests that can help to mitigate the harmful effects of
  chemical pesticides. This study analyzed vegetable growers‚Äô knowledge and
  willingness to adopt botanical pesticides. The data was collected from 202
  vegetable farmers using face-to-face interviews. Descriptive statistics and a
  set of econometric models were used to analyze the data. Only 20% of the
  farmers had good knowledge of botanical pesticides. About 43% of the farmers
  were willing to adopt botanical pesticides. Education, training, extension
  contact, and cosmopolite behavior (communication with other people)
  significantly enhanced the knowledge of the vegetable growers. With
  membership in IPM club and extension contacts, the odds of willingness to
  adopt increased by a factor of 7.60 and 4.23, respectively. The use of modern
  information and communication technology can assist the adoption of botanical
  pesticides by increasing farmers‚Äô knowledge. Providing farmers with
  training on the easy preparation of homemade botanical pesticides can also
  aid in their widespread adoption.%

    <p>Integrated pest management (IPM) has been promoted globally as an
  alternative approach to the widespread broad-spectrum chemical insecticidal
  application for the control of pests and diseases in agricultural production
  to minimise the harmful effects of the chemicals on humans and the
  environment. This study examines the impact of an IPM strategy developed to
  control mango fruit flies on humans and the environment. Using a random
  sample of 371 mango farmers from Meru County in Kenya, health and
  environmental outcomes were measured using the environmental impact quotient
  (EIQ) field use and causal impacts, which were estimated using the endogenous
  switching regression (ESR) model. The results indicate that the adoption of
  the IPM strategy reduced pesticide use and pesticide toxicity. Policy efforts
  therefore should focus on promoting and disseminating fruit fly IPM to
  improve the livelihoods of rural mango farmers, but also reduce human health
  and environmental threats as a result of pesticide use.</p>%

    This study evaluates the drivers of the adoption and dis-adoption of
  Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices in the suppression of mango
  fruit-fly infestation in Embu County, Kenya. It employs a Correlated Random
  Effects Probit Model and a Discrete-time Proportional Hazard Model on
  two-wave panel data of 149 mango farmers selected using a cluster sampling
  technique. The descriptive results show that 59% and 17% of the respondents
  were adopters and dis-adopters of mango fruit fly IPM practices,
  respectively. Empirical findings reveal that the cost of IPM and training on
  IPM positively and significantly influenced adoption, while the
  unavailability of the technology had a negative and significant effect on
  adoption. For dis-adoption, the results indicate that farm size and the
  quality of IPM positively influenced the hazard of exit from IPM use, and
  hence, enhanced the sustained adoption of IPM. The study recommends capacity
  building for mango farmers through training and increased access to extension
  services to enhance the adoption of this technology and prevent
  dis-adoption.%

    Identifying determinants of integrated pest management (IPM) adoption is
  crucial for promoting the use of more ecologically benign pest control
  tactics in the agricultural sector. The present study examined farmers‚Äô
  perception of IPM and determinants of IPM adoption in vegetables production
  in Bangladesh. A total of 350 vegetable farmers were surveyed. Approximately
  one-third of the farmers agreed that the implementation of IPM is beneficial
  for farmers‚Äô health. Overall knowledge regarding various IPM practices was
  low. The adoption of IPM was positively associated with farmers‚Äô education,
  spouses‚Äô education, large farm size, mass media coverage, and high
  perception of pesticide applications cost. Marginal effect analysis showed
  that mass media coverage can increase the likelihood of being in medium and
  high adopter group by 9.2 and 3%, respectively. Increased investment in
  extension services is recommended to increase awareness and adoption of IPM.
  Moreover, modifying the current extension approach by targeting not just the
  primary farmers, but also members of their families can help adoption of
  IPM.%

    The invasive fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis poses a major threat to the
  production and trade of mango in sub-Saharan Africa. Farmers devise different
  innovations to manage the pest in an attempt to minimize yield loss and
  production costs while maximizing revenues. Using survey data obtained from
  Embu County, Kenya, we analyzed farmers‚Äô knowledge and perception as
  regards the invasive fruit fly, their innovations for the management of the
  pest, and the determinants of their adoption and dis-adoption decisions of
  recently developed and promoted integrated pest management (IPM) technologies
  for suppression of the pest. The results show that farmers consider fruit
  flies as a major threat to mango production (99%) and primarily depend on
  pesticides (90%) for the management of the pest. Some farmers (35%) however
  use indigenous methods to manage the pest. Though farmers possess good
  knowledge of different IPM strategies, uptake is relatively low. The
  regression estimates show that continued use of IPM is positively associated
  with the gender and education of the household head, size of a mango orchard,
  knowledge on mango pests, training, contact with an extension officer, and
  use of at least one non-pesticide practice for fruit fly management, while
  IPM dis-adoption was negatively correlated with the size of the mango
  orchard, practice score and use of indigenous innovations for fruit fly
  management. We recommend enhancing farmer0s knowledge through increased
  access to training programs and extension services for enhanced adoption of
  sustainable management practices for B. dorsalis.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The introduction of sustainable practices is considered a win-win strategy
  for low-income countries because of its potential to simultaneously improve
  food security and address environmental issues. Despite the numerous studies
  that focus on the adoption of technological innovations, little work has been
  done on the socio-psychological behaviour of farmers with regard to
  sustainable practices. This study investigates smallholder farmers'
  intentions towards two practices: minimum tillage and row planting. The
  decomposed theory of planned behaviour is used as a theoretical framework to
  analyse the intentions. The findings reveal that attitudes and normative
  issues positively explain farmers' intentions to adopt both practices.
  Perceived control also has a positive significant effect on the intention to
  apply minimum tillage. When the intention is formed, farmers are expected to
  carry out their intention when opportunities arise. Moreover, perceived
  usefulness, social capital, and perceived ease of operation are also
  significant predictors of farmers' attitudes. Furthermore, social capital and
  training are factors that positively affect the normative issue, which in
  turn also positively mediates the relationship between training, social
  capital and intention. Finally, it is shown that neither the perceived
  resources nor information from the media significantly affect farmers'
  intentions. This paper thus confirms that social capital, personal efficacy,
  training and perceived usefulness play significant roles in the decision to
  adopt sustainable practices. In addition, willingness to adopt seems to be
  limited by negative attitudes and by weak normative issues. Therefore, to
  improve adoption of sustainable practices by smallholder farmers, attention
  should be given to socio-psychological issues. This could lead to
  improvements in farm productivity and enhance the livelihoods of
  smallholders.%

    In many economic settings, the variable of interest is often a fraction or
  a proportion, being defined only on the unit interval. The bounded nature of
  such variables and, in some cases, the possibility of nontrivial probability
  mass accumulating at one or both boundaries raise some interesting estimation
  and inference issues. In this paper we (i) provide a comprehensive survey of
  the main alternative models and estimation methods suitable to deal with
  fractional response variables, (ii) propose a full testing methodology to
  assess the validity of the assumptions required by each alternative estimator
  and (iii) examine the finite-sample properties of most of the estimators and
  tests discussed through an extensive Monte Carlo study. An application
  concerning corporate capital structure choices is also provided. ¬© 2009

    There is a growing concern in society about the continuing intensive usage
  of pesticides in farming and its effects on environmental and human health.
  Insight in the intentions of farmers to reduce pesticide use may help
  identify pathways towards farming systems with reduced environmental impacts.
  We used the Reasoned Action Approach to identify which social-psychological
  constructs determine farmers' intentions to decrease pesticide use. We
  analysed 681 responses to an online survey to assess which constructs drive
  intention, and identified which beliefs pose barriers and drive the
  motivation of farmers to decrease pesticide use. Our results show that the
  intention to reduce pesticide use is strongly determined by whether other
  farmers also act. Furthermore, farmers perceive limited capacity and autonomy
  to reduce pesticide use, and motivations to reduce pesticide use were based
  on environmental considerations. Finally, decreasing pesticide use was
  considered risky, but the relative importance of risk attitude was offset by
  the environmental considerations of farmers. This indicates that farmers need
  successful examples of how to decrease pesticide use, either via exchange
  with peer farmers or knowledge provisioning on alternative pest control
  methods. These insights may be useful to direct policy making to influence
  farmers' intentions to decrease pesticide use.%

    Pesticides are an important and widely used tool for crop protection, but
  they also pose significant risks to agricultural sustainability, human health
  and the environment. In this paper, we examine whether mass media campaigns
  can help improve pesticide knowledge and change pesticide use behaviour among
  smallholder farmers in Rwanda and Uganda. We also assess the individual and
  combined effects of the campaign channels, which include interactive radio,
  plant health rallies, mobile SMS and video screenings. Applying a doubly
  robust method to survey data from 1327 maize-producing households across the
  two countries, we find that the mass media campaigns are significantly
  associated with improved farmer knowledge of pesticide risks and safety
  precautions. While the campaigns appear not to have discouraged the use of
  synthetic pesticides, they are significantly associated with increased
  adoption of safer alternatives to pesticides, including sustainable
  integrated pest management practices. The campaigns are also significantly
  correlated with increased use of protective equipment against pesticide
  exposure in both countries and reduced incidence of pesticide-related
  illnesses in Rwanda. We conclude that mass media campaigns (particularly
  using multiple complementary channels) can be effective in enhancing
  farmers‚Äô knowledge about pesticide risks and safety measures, and promote
  the adoption of safer pest management strategies.%

    Purpose: Access to formal financial services is one of the main obstacles
  to the adoption of agricultural technologies such as Sustainable Agricultural
  Practices (SAPs). In order to increase financial inclusion and lessen
  farmers' liquidity restrictions, Village Savings and Loans Associations
  (VSLA) are being promoted in rural farming communities. However, there extent
  to which VSLA contributes to the acceleration of agricultural practices, such
  as SAP, remains little explored in existing literature. The objective of this
  study was to quantitatively assess the impact of VSLA on the intensity of
  adoption of SAPs. Design/methodology/approach: This study used
  cross-sectional data from 376 farming households in the East Gonja district
  of Ghana. An Endogenous Poisson Treatment Regression (EPTR) was applied to
  correct for self-selection bias that might emanate from both observed and
  unobserved differences in household characteristics. Findings: The empirical
  results indicated that farmers' engagement in non-farm economic activities,
  ownership of land and size of agricultural land under cultivation positively
  and significantly influence the intensity of SAPs adoption. Moreover,
  participation in VSLA improves the adoption of SAPs, and that
  VSLA-participants adopted about three more SAPs than they would have if they
  did not participate in VSLA. Practical implications: This study re-affirmed
  the significance of VSLA in rural farming communities and recommend that it
  should be promoted as an alternative to formal financial services to enhance
  financial inclusiveness, and consequently boost the uptake of SAPs.
  Originality/value: In the search of literature, this study is the first to
  estimate the impact of VSLA on adoption of SAPs. The use of EPTR helps to
  bring out the true treatment effects of VSLA on SAPs.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Among the critical challenges affecting crop production and agricultural
  productivity in most developing countries are declining soil fertility and
  the incidence of crop pests and diseases. Hence, there have been efforts by
  scientists and policy-makers especially in sub-Saharan Africa to promote the
  uptake of agronomic and production practices that address these challenges.
  This study, therefore, aimed at investigating the drivers of adoption of crop
  protection and soil fertility (CPSF) management practices among soybean
  farmers in rural Ghana. The management practices investigated included
  application of chemical fertilizers, biofertilizers (inoculants) and
  herbicides. The study was motivated by the critical roles that adoption of
  CPSF management practices play in promoting agricultural productivity.
  Multivariate probit (MVP) and censored Tobit modelling were used to estimate
  adoption and intensity of adoption, respectively. Adoption of rhizobium
  inoculant and chemical fertilizer, as well as adoption of rhizobium inoculant
  and herbicide application, were mutually exclusive, while adoption of
  chemical fertilizer and herbicide were found to be complementary. Adoption
  intensity was higher for female farmers and increased with age, herd size,
  farm capital and farm size. Furthermore, institutional factors were more
  influential in the case of inoculant and herbicide adoption while for
  fertilizer adoption, farmer characteristics were the influential factors. The
  study recommends that policies to promote adoption should take into account
  the interdependence among the technologies. Also, there is the need to target
  farmers who cannot afford the cost of inputs with support in the form of
  input subsidies to reduce partial adoption.%
